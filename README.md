# LeafyIs...

This is my first ever Twitter bot.  All it does is tweet every single English word preceeded by the text "LeafyIs".  Why?  Because I'm a LeafyIsHere fan and I felt like coding this.

The bot is active on Twitter and you can follow it at https://twitter.com/LeafyWord. It tries to tweet every hour.  The bot is written in Node, in a single js file.  It's a pain to get it running though, since you need a twitter dev account and LOTS of patience. So, I guess, just... marvel at the fact this thing works in the first place? I dunno. I'm just hoping Calvin himself sees this and finds it funny. Probably won't happen though knowing my luck. If he does read this, though, then all I can say is.............Leafy is here.

.....that was the lamest joke I have EVER put in a github readme.
